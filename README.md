# ✨ Responsive Landing Page – Figma to Code

A fully responsive and animated landing page built from a Figma design using **React** and **Framer Motion**. This project demonstrates my ability to take a static UI/UX design and bring it to life with modern frontend tools and responsive layouts.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This landing page was crafted based on a Figma design, emphasizing pixel-perfect implementation, smooth animations, and adaptability across devices. It serves as a demonstration of my frontend skills including:

- Interpreting and translating design files
- Building responsive layouts
- Applying animations with Framer Motion
- Writing clean, modular React code

---

## 💡 Features

- 🎨 Built 100% from a Figma design (no templates)
- 📱 Fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- 🧩 Clean React component structure
- ✨ Framer Motion animations for dynamic UI experience
- 🌈 Modern CSS styling (can be Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules / SCSS – depending on what you used)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- **React.js** – Functional components and hooks
- **Framer Motion** – Smooth entrance/exit and scroll-based animations
- **CSS / TailwindCSS / Styled Components** – *(Specify what you used)*
- **Figma** – UI source design
